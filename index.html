    <p>Today we had our School Debate contest and I was shortlisted in the A team. The topic given was ‘Environment pollution’ and I was really excited as it is a topic close to my heart. The judges were from ABC Technical College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict to me.
      Our team started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>

The menus are carefully prepared with the support of a nutritionist, respecting the nutritional balance, taking into account anthropometric values and favouring local seasonal foods, traditional dishes or the most appreciated in each location. Numbers talking, about 2700 meals/day are provided by these social institutions, while 1300 are provided from the two municipal central kitchens.</p>

They will be able to see attendance being recorded in real time as students scan into class or teachers can record attendance themselves. Attendance statuses are automatically sent to the front office and your SIS. If a child doesn’t show up when expected, the parent can receive an automatic alert.
